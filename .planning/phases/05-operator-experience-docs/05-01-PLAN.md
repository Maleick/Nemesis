<objective>
Update startup validation and incident triage runbooks so operators have executable, profile-aware command flows aligned with current runtime behavior.

Purpose: satisfy OPS-01 by reducing operational ambiguity and ensuring runbook instructions are copy/paste executable.
Output: updated runbook docs and deterministic command-consistency checks.

## Task 1
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Normalize startup validation runbook in quickstart and troubleshooting docs</name>
  <files>docs/quickstart.md, docs/troubleshooting.md</files>
  <action>Add a consistent startup validation sequence that always runs `./tools/nemesis-ctl.sh status <dev|prod> [--monitoring] [--jupyter] [--llm]` after startup, defines healthy/degraded/unhealthy interpretation, and provides first-response remediation steps for failures.</action>
  <verify>rg -n "nemesis-ctl.sh status|healthy|degraded|unhealthy|docker compose logs" docs/quickstart.md docs/troubleshooting.md</verify>
  <done>Startup runbook is explicit, profile-aware, and executable without inference.</done>
</task>

## Task 2
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Consolidate incident triage flow and observability command references</name>
  <files>docs/troubleshooting.md, docs/usage_guide.md</files>
  <action>Refactor triage guidance into a clear order-of-operations that includes lifecycle, observability summary, and sustained-alert evaluation commands and aligns language between usage and troubleshooting docs.</action>
  <verify>rg -n "workflows/lifecycle|workflows/observability/summary|alerts/evaluate|incident|triage" docs/troubleshooting.md docs/usage_guide.md</verify>
  <done>Operators can follow one ordered triage sequence from symptom to diagnosis.</done>

## Task 3
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add deterministic operator-doc command consistency checks</name>
  <files>tools/tests/test_operator_docs_commands.sh</files>
  <action>Create a shell-based docs consistency check that fails when required startup and triage commands disappear from runbook docs.</action>
  <verify>bash tools/tests/test_operator_docs_commands.sh</verify>
  <done>Runbook command drift is automatically detectable and reproducible.</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `bash tools/tests/test_operator_docs_commands.sh` passes
- [ ] `rg -n "nemesis-ctl.sh status|healthy|degraded|unhealthy" docs/quickstart.md docs/troubleshooting.md` shows expected runbook command guidance
- [ ] `rg -n "workflows/lifecycle|workflows/observability/summary|alerts/evaluate" docs/troubleshooting.md docs/usage_guide.md` shows triage command coverage
- [ ] OPS-01 evidence recorded: startup validation and incident triage runbooks are executable and profile-aligned
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- OPS-01 is satisfied by executable startup and incident triage runbooks
- Operator docs use consistent command vocabulary and profile semantics
- Runbook command drift is test-detectable

</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-operator-experience-docs/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
