<objective>
Add profile startup matrix validation and operator-facing guidance so readiness and workflow failure states are verifiable and actionable.

Purpose: complete Phase 1 by ensuring readiness behavior is operationally enforced, not only implemented in service code.
Output: startup validation wiring, CI/readiness checks, and updated troubleshooting documentation.

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Startup matrix checks run for each profile in a representative environment
- [ ] CI workflow includes readiness-related regression check
- [ ] Documentation accurately describes observed readiness behavior and remediation steps
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Profile readiness validation is operationalized
- Workflow failure and dependency outage handling is actionable for operators
- Documentation and automation provide a consistent startup troubleshooting flow

</success_criteria>
