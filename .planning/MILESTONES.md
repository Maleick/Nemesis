# Milestones

## v1.0 milestone (Shipped: 2026-02-26)

**Phases completed:** 9 phases, 20 plans, 60 tasks

### Key Accomplishments

- Startup readiness contracts and profile-aware health behavior are deterministic and test-gated across operator workflows.
- Workflow observability now exposes severity-scored queue/failure/service-health signals with sustained-condition alerting and triage paths.
- Security/auth hardening added secret-safe logging and deterministic auth/preflight behavior across agents and web API.
- End-to-end quality gates (backend/frontend/queue contracts) are now first-class CI and local verification paths.
- Throughput controls, workload policies, and multi-node capacity operations are implemented with runbook-backed rollback and evidence contracts.
- AI governance now surfaces confidence-aware policy context plus budget/fail-safe observability with deterministic API/UI/docs contract gates.
