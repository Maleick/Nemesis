### Key Accomplishments

- Startup readiness matrix, CI contract guards, and operator triage docs now enforce profile-aware health behavior.
- Dashboard exposes severity-scored queue/workflow/service-health signals with sustained-condition alerting and direct triage navigation.
- Auth-mode drift and chatbot credential preflight now surface as deterministic, secret-safe status contracts across agents and web API.
- Queue/topic/payload contracts are centralized and CI-enforced across web_api, file_enrichment, and alerting boundaries.
- Operator docs and observability triage UX are aligned and regression-protected.
- Extension onboarding is validation-first, and throughput tuning is baseline-driven with benchmark guardrails.

### Known Gaps Accepted At Close

- Milestone closed without a separate `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` artifact.
