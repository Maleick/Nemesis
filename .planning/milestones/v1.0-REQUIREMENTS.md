# Requirements Archive: v1.0 milestone

**Archived:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SHIPPED

This archive preserves the final v1.0 requirement state at milestone completion.

## v1 Requirement Outcomes

### Service Reliability

- [x] **RELI-01**: Core services expose deterministic readiness checks that validate required dependencies before reporting healthy
- [x] **RELI-02**: Profile-specific startup (`base`, `monitoring`, `llm`) produces an actionable pass/fail health summary
- [x] **RELI-03**: Workflow failures surface clear retry/recovery state instead of silent stalls
- [x] **RELI-04**: Dependency outages are reported with remediation-oriented error context in service health/status endpoints

### Observability

- [x] **OBS-01**: Operators can correlate file processing lifecycle across ingestion, workflow execution, and result publication using object-level identifiers
- [x] **OBS-02**: Queue backlog, workflow failure, and service-health signals are visible in dashboards suitable for routine operations
- [x] **OBS-03**: Sustained backlog/failure conditions trigger alerts with enough context to triage quickly

### Security & Auth

- [x] **SEC-01**: Secret values are never emitted in service logs during startup, runtime, or error handling
- [x] **SEC-02**: LLM/auth mode misconfiguration is detected early and surfaced as explicit unhealthy status with remediation guidance
- [x] **SEC-03**: Startup preflight validates critical credential alignment for chatbot/agent database access paths

### Quality Gates

- [x] **TEST-01**: CI includes an automated smoke test for upload -> enrichment -> retrieval critical path
- [x] **TEST-02**: CI validates profile-aware smoke behavior for alerting and llm-dependent service paths
- [x] **TEST-03**: Frontend critical navigation and result-view workflow is covered by automated smoke checks
- [x] **TEST-04**: Contract tests enforce queue/topic/payload compatibility for producer-consumer boundaries

### Operator Experience

- [x] **OPS-01**: Runbooks for startup validation, incident triage, and profile troubleshooting are up to date and executable
- [x] **OPS-02**: Compose profile documentation matches current deployment commands and expected outcomes

### Extensibility

- [x] **EXT-01**: New enrichment modules have a documented contract template and verification checklist
- [x] **EXT-02**: Connector onboarding includes schema/config validation guidance that prevents runtime miswiring

## Notes

- No formal `v1.0` milestone audit artifact existed at archival time.
- Requirement rows for OPS/EXT were stale in the live requirements file before archival and were normalized here using Phase 5/6 verification and UAT results.
