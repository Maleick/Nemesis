# Requirements: Nemesis Platform Evolution

**Defined:** 2026-02-25
**Core Value:** Turn collected offensive-operations artifacts into actionable, trustworthy findings quickly and safely.

## v1.1 Requirements

### Scale & Throughput

- [ ] **SCALE-01**: Operators can apply partitioned throughput controls with measurable queue-drain targets for high-volume workflows.
- [ ] **SCALE-02**: Expensive enrichment classes are governed by policy-driven throttling that preserves baseline workflow responsiveness.
- [ ] **SCALE-03**: Operators can deploy and validate multi-node capacity profiles using documented, executable runbooks.

### AI Governance

- [x] **AI-01**: AI triage outputs expose confidence-aware policy mode and preserve explicit operator override controls.
- [x] **AI-02**: Operators can monitor AI usage/cost governance signals with budget-oriented warning states.

## v2 Requirements

### Scale & Platform Evolution

- **SCALE-04**: Support dynamic autoscaling recommendations based on live queue/service pressure telemetry.
- **SCALE-05**: Add environment-diff tooling for profile parity checks across dev/stage/prod.

### Advanced Analysis

- **AI-03**: Add cached synthesis strategy with invalidation controls for repeat report requests.
- **AI-04**: Provide policy simulation mode for AI triage decisions before enforcement.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Kubernetes migration in v1.1 | Docker Compose is the committed operator model for this cycle. |
| Fully autonomous finding mutation by AI | Requires stronger trust/safety controls than current milestone scope. |
| Broad architecture rewrite away from Dapr workflows | High-risk disruption without direct milestone value. |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SCALE-01 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| SCALE-02 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| SCALE-03 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| AI-01 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| AI-02 | Phase 9 | Complete |
