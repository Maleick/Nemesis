# Milestone v1.0: milestone

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-25  
**Phases:** 1-6  
**Total Plans:** 14

## Overview

v1.0 completed Nemesis brownfield hardening priorities: deterministic startup health contracts, workflow observability, auth/logging safety, CI quality gates, operator runbook alignment, and extension/performance onboarding guardrails.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Service Health Contracts

**Goal:** Establish deterministic startup/readiness contracts for all key services and profiles.  
**Depends on:** Nothing  
**Plans:** 3

- [x] 01-01: Define and normalize startup/readiness contract behavior across services
- [x] 01-02: Implement profile-aware readiness matrix checks and service health reporting
- [x] 01-03: Add workflow failure/recovery state instrumentation at service boundaries

### Phase 2: Workflow Observability Baseline

**Goal:** Make queue/workflow/object lifecycle behavior easy to observe and diagnose.  
**Depends on:** Phase 1  
**Plans:** 2

- [x] 02-01: Implement object-level workflow correlation and status signal propagation
- [x] 02-02: Build/validate dashboards and alerts for queue/workflow/service health

### Phase 3: Security & Auth Hardening

**Goal:** Harden auth and logging paths so credential and mode drift is visible and safe.  
**Depends on:** Phase 2  
**Plans:** 2

- [x] 03-01: Enforce secret-safe logging and redact sensitive startup/error outputs
- [x] 03-02: Tighten auth-mode and chatbot credential preflight validation and status behavior

### Phase 4: End-to-End Quality Gates

**Goal:** Raise release confidence with smoke and contract validation for critical workflows.  
**Depends on:** Phase 3  
**Plans:** 3

- [x] 04-01: Add cross-service ingestion/enrichment/retrieval smoke automation
- [x] 04-02: Add frontend critical-path smoke checks and CI integration
- [x] 04-03: Add queue/topic/payload contract tests for producer-consumer boundaries

### Phase 5: Operator Experience & Docs

**Goal:** Make operational workflows clear, executable, and aligned with current runtime behavior.  
**Depends on:** Phase 4  
**Plans:** 2

- [x] 05-01: Update/validate startup and incident runbooks against real profile behavior
- [x] 05-02: Align operator documentation and health-summary UX with current workflows

### Phase 6: Extension Contracts & Performance

**Goal:** Improve extension velocity and performance confidence without destabilizing core behavior.  
**Depends on:** Phase 5  
**Plans:** 2

- [x] 06-01: Define extension contracts/checklists for enrichment modules and connectors
- [x] 06-02: Baseline and tune key throughput bottlenecks with guardrail metrics

## Milestone Summary

**Key accomplishments:**

- Startup readiness matrix, CI contract guard, and operator triage docs now enforce profile-aware health behavior.
- Dashboard now exposes severity-scored queue/workflow/service-health signals with sustained-condition alert behavior.
- Auth-mode drift and chatbot credential preflight now resolve to deterministic and secret-safe status contracts.
- Queue/topic/payload contracts are centrally defined and CI-enforced across service boundaries.
- Compose/operator triage docs and frontend help routing are aligned and regression-protected.
- Connector onboarding is validation-first and throughput tuning is baseline-driven with benchmark guardrails.

**Issues resolved:**

- Closed all planned phases and completed Phase 6 UAT with `5` passes and `0` issues.

**Known gaps accepted at close:**

- Milestone was closed without a standalone `v1.0` milestone-audit artifact.
