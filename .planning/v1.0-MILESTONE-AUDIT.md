# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

## Scope

- Milestone: `v1.0`
- Phase range: `01`-`06`
- Inputs used:
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `.planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md`
  - `.planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md`
  - `.planning/phases/06-extension-contracts-performance/06-UAT.md`

## Findings

### Phase Verification Coverage

| Phase | Verification Artifact | Status |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| 01 | missing | GAP |
| 02 | 02-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 03 | 03-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 04 | 04-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 05 | 05-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 06 | 06-VERIFICATION.md | passed |

### Requirement Coverage (3-source cross-reference)

- Summary frontmatter confirms all v1 REQ IDs are claimed complete by plan execution.
- Archived requirements file marks all v1 requirements complete.
- Verification artifact coverage is incomplete for Phase 1 because `01-VERIFICATION.md` is missing.

| Requirement Group | Count | Result |
|-------------------|-------|--------|
| RELI-* | 4 | partial (verification artifact missing) |
| OBS-* | 3 | satisfied |
| SEC-* | 3 | satisfied |
| TEST-* | 4 | satisfied |
| OPS-* | 2 | satisfied |
| EXT-* | 2 | satisfied |

## Status Rationale

Audit status is `gaps_found` because milestone-audit rules require a verification artifact per phase. Missing Phase 1 verification prevents full audit pass even though plan summaries and downstream phases indicate delivery completion.

## Recommended Follow-up

1. Generate `01-VERIFICATION.md` retroactively from Phase 1 outputs and evidence.
2. Re-run milestone audit to clear `RELI-*` requirements from partial to satisfied.
