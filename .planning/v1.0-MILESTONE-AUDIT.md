# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

## Scope

- Milestone: `v1.0`
- Phase range: `01`-`06`
- Inputs used:
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `.planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md`
  - `.planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md`
  - `.planning/phases/06-extension-contracts-performance/06-UAT.md`

## Findings

### Phase Verification Coverage

| Phase | Verification Artifact | Status |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| 01 | 01-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 02 | 02-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 03 | 03-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 04 | 04-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 05 | 05-VERIFICATION.md | passed |
| 06 | 06-VERIFICATION.md | passed |

### Requirement Coverage (3-source cross-reference)

Cross-check sources used:
1. `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md` traceability and completion rows
2. `.planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md` requirement status tables
3. `.planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md` `requirements-completed` frontmatter

Result: all milestone requirements are represented and satisfied.

| Requirement Group | Count | Result |
|-------------------|-------|--------|
| RELI-* | 4 | satisfied |
| OBS-* | 3 | satisfied |
| SEC-* | 3 | satisfied |
| TEST-* | 4 | satisfied |
| OPS-* | 2 | satisfied |
| EXT-* | 2 | satisfied |

### Cross-Phase Integration and End-to-End Flows

- Service health contract wiring is consistent across web_api, agents, file_enrichment, document_conversion, and alerting.
- Workflow observability and alert-evaluation endpoints are implemented and verified with frontend triage surface integration.
- Queue/topic contract checks and smoke gates are present and validated in CI-facing guard scripts.
- Operator runbooks and extension/connector onboarding guidance are aligned with executable checks.

## Status Rationale

Audit status is `passed`: all milestone requirements are satisfied, all phases are verified, and no critical integration or end-to-end flow blockers remain.

## Recommended Next Step

- Milestone closure quality gates are complete. Proceed with next milestone setup via `$gsd-new-milestone`.
