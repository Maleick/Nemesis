# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Turn collected offensive-operations artifacts into actionable, trustworthy findings quickly and safely.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.0 archived; ready to initialize the next milestone.

## Current Position

Phase: complete (9 of 9)
Plan: complete (20 of 20)
Status: Milestone v1.0 complete and archived; ready for `$gsd-new-milestone`
Last activity: 2026-02-26 - Archived v1.0 (phases 1-9) with passed milestone audit

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Preserve verification-first execution and explicit phase verification artifacts in each phase.
- Keep deterministic local/CI contract gates for health, observability, capacity, and AI-governance surfaces.
- Milestone closeout requires audit status `passed` before archival.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No active blockers.
- Next milestone scope is not yet initialized.

## Session Continuity

Last major action: Archived milestone v1.0 and moved audit to `.planning/milestones/` on 2026-02-26.
