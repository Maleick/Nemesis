# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Turn collected offensive-operations artifacts into actionable, trustworthy findings quickly and safely.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 planning for throughput controls and workload policies.

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 9 (not started)
Plan: 0 of 0 in current phase
Status: Milestone v1.1 initialized with requirements and roadmap; ready for phase discussion/planning
Last activity: 2026-02-25 - Defined v1.1 requirements and roadmap (phases 7-9)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Continue Docker Compose + Dapr architecture model for v1.1.
- Preserve verification-first execution and explicit phase verification artifacts.
- Prioritize `SCALE-*` before `AI-*` changes in this milestone to stabilize runtime behavior first.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No active blockers.
- Phase 7 planning should lock measurable throughput targets before implementation.

## Session Continuity

Last major action: Milestone v1.1 requirements and roadmap initialization on 2026-02-25.
